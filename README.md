### **Final Submission due 2359HRS Friday 9 October 2026**

#### Assignment 1
Task is to build a system known as the "System Under Test", establish performance and accuracy requirements for it, and design and execute tests that determine whether or not the system meets those requirements. Your work ends in a recommendation to a client.

The requirements, instrumentation, golden test set, and baseline measurements from this assignment will form the basis of optimisation and performance tuning in your second assignment.

#### Client Scenario

Your client is a financial services company whose customer relations desk receives a steady stream of complaint tickets. Today, every ticket is read and routed by a human. The client wants incoming tickets classified automatically by category, so that they can be routed to the right team.

**The client's constraint: no public model API may be used**. Ticket narratives contain sensitive customer financial information, and the client's compliance rules do not permit this data to leave their infrastructure. All model inference must run on hardware the client controls, and the client's available hardware is commodity CPU servers with no GPUs. Your engagement is therefore a constraint problem. The question is not "which model is best". The question is: given these constraints, what should the client deploy, and what service quality can you promise?

AI coding tools are permitted and expected throughout. The build is a few hours' work with an agent, and that is accepted. AI-generated code is typically correct but performance-naive, and an agent will not label your test data, run your load tests, or make your recommendation. The assessment targets measurement, interpretation, and judgement.


### Deliverables
#### Submission Format
- One PowerPoint file, maximum 12 slides, plus the supporting files listed below.
-	Submit via xSiTe by 2359 Friday 9 October 2026 (Week 6).
-	File name format: GroupNum.pptx, e.g. Group01.pptx.
-	Supporting files, in the same submission: the golden test set (final labels for the 150 to 200 tickets, identified by row number); 
the prediction record (the three items listed in Step 4); 
and the labelling protocol with its revisions, the independent label sheets, and the agreement statistic.

The golden test set and the prediction record must also be committed to your repository before your first benchmark run. 

The commit history is your evidence that your labels and predictions predate your measurements. 

Keep your raw JMeter .jtl files and service logs in the repository as well; you will not submit them, but every number in your document must reconcile with them, and you may be asked to produce and explain them.
